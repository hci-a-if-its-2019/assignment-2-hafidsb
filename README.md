# Sketching and Prototyping
Using the information in the results of Assignment 1 for what is good and bad about the UI for designed tasks, we are going to make **Sketches** and **Prototypes**. These sketches and prototypes will lead to better design in Assignment 3. The prototypes will be then tested through a usability evaluation followed by design revision in Assignment 4.

## Part A: Sketches
Sketch at least **3 (three)** different UIs for the functions you are targeting. These three interfaces should be _dramatically different_ in terms of design directions. For example, they can be with different organizations of what functions on each screen or using a different layout of the icons, widgets, and menus on the screens. If you want, you can also incorporate non-on-screen UIs: physical buttons, gestures through motion sensors, etc.

You need **not** sketch the whole interface. It is not necessary for the sketches to have every function or every function in detail, but there should be enough to show off your general idea. **Be creative!** Draw your idea and label a few of the widgets so we can tell your intent. The goal is to have at least 3 good UIs in *interesting* ways. Sketches should be done on paper with pens and/or pencils (do not use a computer).

Be sure to label the different versions so you can differentiate them in your discussion. 
If you choose to take a picture of your sketches, please make sure the texts are readable.

#### Original Design

#### First Proposed Design

#### Second Proposed Design

#### Third Proposed Design

### 2. Version Differences

The originial design's home screen crumples information in every sections, making it unreadable and unnatractive. Generally in all those proposed design I try to squeeze all the information into tiny digestable pieces of information in the form of link to another pages that have those specific informations, but with different approaches. In the first design I utilize top navbar as the placeholder of the link buttons, and display general necessary information in the home screen. While in the second design, I want to display a bit more information but packed accordingly. With product display that is based on category, with search bar on the top, and some helper widget like home button, account button, and a burger icon button that displays additional important link on the site. Then finally on my last proposed design, I suggest simpler home screen view. With only logo, a search bar, short & precise information, and additional important links, make it obvious to the visitor of what the website is capable of with minimalist effort. 


### 3. Selected Sketch

Personally, I think the third design is easy to implement with bigger result. But living on the online era, I've found many great online shops where my second proposed design is based on. And also, those online shop design is already tested and improved gradually. So I think second design will be my choice. 


### 4. Design Rationale

I learned that not all people(but, many I guess) are as tech-savy as many of us in Informatics Department. As for how it affect my design, I feel because my selection is a generally bad UI design, what I got from the contextual inquiry process did not affect my design much.  

## Part B: Assumptions
### 1. Hardware
```
Expected hardware: a PC / laptop accomodated with mouse or touch pad, with colored 1366x768 screen. 

```
### 2. Users
```
Expected user: A novice on using laptop / PC and on using web browser, aged 9-60, familiar with online shopping
